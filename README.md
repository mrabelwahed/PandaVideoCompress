## Setup

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```

allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
        
        
       
 
 ## Add the dependency
  
  
  
   implementation 'com.github.mrabelwahed:PandaVideoCompress:1.0'
   
  ```

## Usage
### Call compressVideoLow, compressVideoMedium and compressVideoHigh that indicates 3 quality of compressing.
        VideoCompress.compressVideoLow(String srcPath, String destPath, new VideoCompress.CompressListener() {
            @Override
            public void onStart() {
                //Start Compress
            }

            @Override
            public void onSuccess(String compressVideoPath) {
                //Finish successfully
            }

            @Override
            public void onFail() {
                //Failed
            }

            @Override
            public void onProgress(float percent) {
                //Progress
            }
        });

## Performance

I compress a video which is 2.62MB(00:0:12).

And it took 8 seconds for compressing.

The result of compressing is 479KB.

So it's a great job by MediaCodec :) .
